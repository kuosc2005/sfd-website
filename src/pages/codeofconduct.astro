    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Software Freedom Day</b> is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
      experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender
      identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
      We invite attendees to come to SFD in a spirit of curiosity, friendliness,
      open-mindedness, and respect. Any kind of harassment will not be
      tolerated.
    </p>
    <h2>At the conference venue, you agree to:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Be kind and sensitive to the people around you and respect the
        boundaries of other attendees.
      </li>
      <li>
        Attempt to resolve differences of opinions peacefully and appropriately
        for a professional environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Listen with empathy when someone has a different perspective and give
        suggestions for improvement.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This Code of Conduct applies to the venue of SFD 2025 Conference,
      pre-event and post-event informal gathering, and all events organized by
      the organizing committee of Software Freedom Day.

    <p>
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
      have any other concerns, please contact someone from the organizing
      committee. Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for
      all.
